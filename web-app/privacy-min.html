        <p><strong>Security, Privacy and Information Practices</strong></p>
        <p>Fair Information Practices are the backbone of privacy laws worldwide, including the
            European Union privacy protections. Our app is designed to adhere to the following Fair
            Information Practices.</p>
        <p>The minimum collection practice: collect only what is necessary to accomplish the task.&nbsp;
            Symptoms, Tests and Contacts are completely self-reported, so only share what you are comfortable with,
            These are the minimum information needed to help the human contact tracer.</p>
        <p>The minimum sharing practice: shared information is the minimal information needed to
            accomplish the task.&nbsp; The only information shared from MarinTrace is with school
            administration, county public health officials, and a human contact tracer for those who
            test positive. The human contact tracer will review this information with the positive
            tested person to make a determination about who may have been contacted and
            infected.</p>
        <p>The access practice: the person who is the subject of the data may have a copy of their
            data and be in control of a copy of their data.&nbsp; A person can receive a copy of
            their own MarinTrace data.&nbsp; The accuracy practice: individuals should be able to
            make
            corrections to their own data.&nbsp; The human contact tracer receives information from
            MarinTrace that relates to a case of a positive tested person and for the purpose of
            reviewing
            the retrieved information with the positive tested person, who can attest to its
            accuracy and whose attestations are the basis for the determinations of likely
            infections to others.</p>
        <p>The audit and consent practice: individual participation is optional.&nbsp; A person can
            opt-out of MarinTrace at any time and can request to audit their data on MarinTrace at
            any time.</p>
        <p>The security practice: technologies comply with stringent security practices.&nbsp;
            MarinTrace
            stores and processes information compliant to the highest online security levels. You can read our <a
