<p><strong>Security, Privacy and Information Practices</strong></p>
<p>Fair Information Practices are the backbone of privacy laws worldwide, including the European Union privacy protections. Our app is designed to adhere to the following Fair Information Practices.</p>
<p>The minimum collection practice: collect only what is necessary to accomplish the task.&nbsp; XXX only captures signal strength and MAC address and record the date and time of the recording. These three pieces of information (signal strength, MAC address, and date-timestamp) are the only information collected. These are the minimum information needed to help the human contact tracer.</p>
<p>The specific information provided to XXX varies by the type of location information the app provides. Only the minimum information about duration, location and a measurement, if known, are provided. This parallels the kinds of information provided to XXX.</p>
<p>The minimum sharing practice: shared information is the minimal information needed to accomplish the task.&nbsp; The only information shared from XXX is with school administration, county public health officials, and a human contact tracer for those who test positive. The human contact tracer will review this information with the positive tested person to make a determination about who may have been contacted and infected.</p>
<p>The access practice: the person who is the subject of the data may have a copy of their data and be in control of a copy of their data.&nbsp; A person can receive a copy of their own XXX data.&nbsp; The accuracy practice: individuals should be able to make corrections to their own data.&nbsp; The human contact tracer receives information from XXX that relates to a case of a positive tested person and for the purpose of reviewing the retrieved information with the positive tested person, who can attest to its accuracy and whose attestations are the basis for the determinations of likely infections to others.</p>
<p>The audit and consent practice: individual participation is optional.&nbsp; A person can opt-out of XXX at any time and can request to audit their data on XXX at any time.</p>
<p>The security practice: technologies comply with stringent security practices.&nbsp; XXX stores and processes information compliant to the highest online security levels.</p>
