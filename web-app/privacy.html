                            <p><strong>Security, Privacy and Information Practices</strong></p>
                            <p>We adhere to Federal Regulations surrounding health information, specifically HIPAA.</p>
                            <p>Fair Information Practices are the backbone of privacy laws worldwide, including the
                                European Union privacy protections. Our app is designed to adhere to the following Fair
                                Information Practices.</p>
                            <p>The minimum collection practice: collect only what is necessary to accomplish the task.&nbsp;
                                Symptoms, Tests and Contacts are completely self-reported, so only share what you are
                                comfortable with,
                                These are the minimum information needed to help the human contact tracer.</p>
                            <p>The minimum sharing practice: shared information is the minimal information needed to
                                accomplish the task.&nbsp; The only information shared from MarinTrace is with school
                                administration, county public health officials, and a human contact tracer for those who
                                test positive. The human contact tracer will review this information with the positive
                                tested person to make a determination about who may have been contacted and
                                infected.</p>
                            <p>The access practice: the person who is the subject of the data may have a copy of their
                                data and be in control of a copy of their data.&nbsp; A person can receive a copy of
                                their own MarinTrace data.&nbsp; The accuracy practice: individuals should be able to
                                make
                                corrections to their own data.&nbsp; The human contact tracer receives information from
                                MarinTrace that relates to a case of a positive tested person and for the purpose of
                                reviewing
                                the retrieved information with the positive tested person, who can attest to its
                                accuracy and whose attestations are the basis for the determinations of likely
                                infections to others.</p>
                            <p>The audit and consent practice: individual participation is optional.&nbsp; A person can
                                opt-out of MarinTrace at any time and can request to audit their data on MarinTrace at
                                any time.</p>
                            <p>The security practice: technologies comply with stringent security practices.&nbsp;
