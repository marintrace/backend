# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the unlikely event that you find a security vulnerability, please handle it RESPECTFULLY! Tell me privately if you find one to prevent bad actors from exploiting it. Thanks so much.

To report a security vulnerability, email me at amrit_baveja@branson.org with the subject "SECURITY VULNERABILITY". If your concern is valid, you may create a pull request, or I can fix it myself.
